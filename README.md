# ts-express
A sample code on how to integrate TS into popular JS library such as Express.
Two methods followed:
  1. Implement type annotation on all possible cases on the middleware functions, routes etc.
  2. Fork around the library, overwrite them as in the library TS_Decorators.
  
 Ideas like decorators, metadata etc implemented.
